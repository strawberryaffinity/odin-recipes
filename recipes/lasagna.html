        How to Make Lasagna
            
        While homemade lasagna may have a few steps, each step is easy and I assure you it's worth the time; the perfect Italian meal!
            
        Boil pasta: In a large pot of salted water boil lasagna noodles per the recipe below.
        Prepare meat sauce: Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta sauce (I love this brand) & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.
        Combine cheese mixture: Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.
        Layer & bake: Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until the top of the lasagna is golden brown.
